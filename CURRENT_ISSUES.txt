CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX
====================

1. **OLED 8 showing "Track 8" on boot instead of PlayOptix logo**
   - Startup splash shows logo correctly
   - Something is overwriting it with track name
   - Need to check state machine transitions

2. **WiFi setup instructions appearing**
   - These were removed last week
   - Something brought them back
   - Need to verify showQuickStartInstructions() isn't being called

3. **Device announcing 192.168.68.100 instead of 127.0.0.1**
   - This is device's WiFi IP, not bridge IP
   - Shouldn't happen in wired mode
   - Need to check if wiredOnly flag is being respected

4. **Heartbeat not displaying on OLED 8**
   - Code added to show dot when /ableton_on received
   - /hello is being sent successfully
   - M4L not responding with /hi yet (needs implementation)
   - Heartbeat won't show until M4L sends /hi back

5. **/hello not showing in browser Serial Monitor**
   - This is CORRECT behavior
   - Serial Monitor = USB only
   - OSC messages (like /hello) show in PowerShell console only
   - Check PowerShell to see "Sent to Ableton: /hello"

WHAT HASN'T BEEN CHANGED
========================
- Track name parsing (still working)
- Offset support
- Serial communication
- Device connection
- Basic functionality

WHAT WAS CHANGED TODAY
======================
- Added handshake system (/hello â†’ /hi)
- Added heartbeat indicator on OLED 8
- Removed Electron, switched to browser
- Updated version to 0.33

ROOT CAUSE
==========
Need to upload Arduino code to device. Current issues 1-3 might be from
old code still running on device, not the new v0.33 code.
