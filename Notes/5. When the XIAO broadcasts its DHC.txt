5. When the XIAO broadcasts its DHCP IP (`192.168.x.y`), the M4L device will:
- **Receive** it on port **9000**  
- **Prepends** `host 192.168.x.y`  
- **Re-targets** its `[udpsend]` to that address on port **8000**

After that, **any OSC messages** you send from tds8.amxd (e.g. `/activetrack`, `/trackname`) will go straight to your OLED display network.

##5Ô∏è‚É£ Troubleshooting

- **Don‚Äôt see `TDS8-Setup` AP?**  
- Add `wm.resetSettings();` just before `wm.autoConnect()` in `setup()`, re-flash, then remove it once configured.  

- **Web UI won‚Äôt load?**  
- Make sure your client is on the same Wi-Fi as the XIAO  
- Try **http://tds8.local** or the numeric IP from Serial Monitor  

- **M4L device not updating?**  
- Confirm that you‚Äôre receiving the UDP string in Max  
- Lock the patch, click the `[udpreceive 9000]` object to open that port  
- Ensure your `[prepend host]` ‚Üí `[udpsend]` chain is intact
