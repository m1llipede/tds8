TDS-8 Bridge — START HERE

What you need
1) TDS-8 hardware (1–4 units)
2) Ableton Live (optional, for auto track names)
3) This folder

Quick steps
1) Plug in your TDS-8 unit(s) via USB. Wait ~5 seconds.
2) Double‑click Start_TDS8_Bridge.bat
   - This closes any old Bridge, starts the backend, and opens the dashboard.
3) In Ableton, drag TDS-8.amxd to an empty MIDI track.
   - The dashboard will show “M4L Connected” and begin receiving track names.
4) In the dashboard, click Connect on each device.
   - Use the dropdown on each device to choose which tracks to show (1–8, 9–16, etc.).
   - You can mirror multiple devices to the same 8‑track block.

Common buttons
- Clear Ports: safely disconnects all devices so Windows can release COM ports.
- Quit Bridge: closes the Bridge app.

Notes
- Mode: Wired (USB) only for this build. IP shows 127.0.0.1 by default.
- If the dashboard does not load, refresh the browser (Ctrl+F5).
- If a device doesn’t appear, unplug/replug and click Clear Ports.

Support workflow
- Firmware updates are under “Firmware Update” in the dashboard.
- Update Custom Track Names applies the names you type in the grid (faster now).

That’s it — start the batch file, add the M4L device, and connect your units.
