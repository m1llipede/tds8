## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **404 Error for Firmware Check** ✅
**Problem:** Getting HTTP 404 when checking for updates

**Solution:**
- Better error handling added
- Now shows clear message: "Firmware manifest not found. The update file may not exist yet at the GitHub repository."
- This means the manifest file doesn't exist at: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m1llipede/tds8/main/manifest.json`

**To Fix Permanently:**
You need to create a `manifest.json` file in your GitHub repo at: `m1llipede/tds8/main/manifest.json`

**Example manifest.json:**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "url": "https://github.com/m1llipede/tds8/releases/download/v1.0.0/firmware.bin",
  "notes": "Initial release"
}
```

### 2. **Read Current Tracks** ✅
**Added:** New "Read Current Tracks" button

**How it works:**
1. Click "Read Current Tracks" button (purple)
2. Sends `/gettracks` command to device
3. Device responds with current track names in serial monitor
4. You can then manually update the UI fields based on what you see

**Button Order:**
- 🟣 **Read Current Tracks** - Get from device
- 🟠 **Update All Tracks** - Send to device
- ⚪ **Reset to Defaults** - Reset UI to defaults

## 🚀 Test Now

```bash
cd /Users/test/Documents/TDS-8/tds8-bridge
npm run electron
```

### Test Track Reading:
1. Connect TDS-8 device
2. Click "Read Current Tracks"
3. Watch serial monitor for track names
4. Device should output current track configuration

### About Firmware 404:
The 404 error is **expected** if you haven't created the manifest file yet. The app now explains this clearly instead of just showing "HTTP 404".

## 📝 Next Steps for Firmware Updates

To enable firmware updates, you need to:

1. **Create manifest.json** in your GitHub repo
2. **Upload firmware.bin** to GitHub releases
3. **Update manifest URL** to point to your firmware

The app is ready - just needs the GitHub files!
