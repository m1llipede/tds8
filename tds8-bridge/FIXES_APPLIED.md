# ✅ Fixes Applied - Read Tracks & Ableton Integration

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Ableton M4L "Refresh displays" Now Works** ✅
**Problem:** Your Max for Live patch couldn't fetch track names from the bridge

**Solution:** Added `/tracks` HTTP endpoint
- **URL:** `http://localhost:8088/tracks`
- **Returns:** `{"names": ["Track 1", "Track 2", ...]}`
- Your M4L patch can now refresh and get current track names!

### 2. **Read Current Tracks Button Works** ✅
**Problem:** Button sent `/gettracks` command which device doesn't support

**Solution:** Changed to return stored track names
- Now returns the track names that were last set via "Update All Tracks"
- Returns: `{"ok": true, "names": ["Track 1", "Track 2", ...]}`

### 3. **Track Names Are Now Stored** ✅
**Problem:** Bridge didn't remember track names between updates

**Solution:** Added `currentTrackNames` array
- Stores all 8 track names in memory
- Updates when you use "Update All Tracks"
- Ableton can fetch these anytime via `/tracks` endpoint

## 🧪 Test It Now

### Test Ableton Integration:
1. Open your M4L patch in Ableton
2. Click "Refresh displays" button
3. Should now populate with track names!

### Test Read Current Tracks:
1. Open bridge app (should be running now)
2. Set some custom track names
3. Click "Update All Tracks"
4. Click "Read Current Tracks"
5. Should show the names you just set

### Test via Terminal:
```bash
# Get current track names
curl http://localhost:8088/tracks

# Should return:
# {"names":["Track 1","Track 2","Track 3","Track 4","Track 5","Track 6","Track 7","Track 8"]}
```

## 📝 About the Firmware 404 Error

The 404 error is **expected** because the manifest file doesn't exist at:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m1llipede/tds8/main/manifest.json`

**To fix:** Upload `manifest.json` to your GitHub repo at that location

**For now:** You can ignore the firmware check - everything else works!

## 🔄 What Changed in the Code

**File:** `/Users/test/Music/TDS-8/tds8-bridge/index.js`

**Added:**
1. `currentTrackNames` array to store track names
2. `GET /tracks` endpoint for Ableton M4L
3. Updated `GET /api/tracknames` to return stored names
4. Updated `POST /api/trackname` to save names to array

**Bridge restarted** with new changes - ready to use!
