# ✅ TDS-8 Bridge - Current Status

## 🎉 What's Working

### **Device Connection**
- ✅ USB device detection
- ✅ Serial port communication
- ✅ Device displays as "TDS-8 (tty.usbmodem14301)"
- ✅ Serial number shown in footer

### **Track Names**
- ✅ Update All Tracks - sends to device
- ✅ Load Stored Tracks - loads from bridge memory
- ✅ Reset to Defaults
- ✅ Track names stored in bridge
- ✅ `/tracks` endpoint for Ableton M4L: `http://localhost:8088/tracks`

### **WiFi Settings**
- ✅ Auto-scan on modal open
- ✅ Shows saved networks (green)
- ✅ Shows available networks
- ✅ Click to connect
- ✅ Add new networks
- ✅ WiFi scanning works on Mac & Windows

### **OSC Broadcasting (NEW!)**
- ✅ Broadcasts `/ipupdate 127.0.0.1` to port 9000
- ✅ Auto-broadcasts when device connects
- ✅ Manual trigger: `POST /api/broadcast-ip`
- ✅ M4L should receive IP on `udpreceive 9000`

### **UI Improvements**
- ✅ Shows serial port name with device
- ✅ "MANUALLY ADD NETWORK" text is black
- ✅ Footer shows company name and serial number
- ✅ Network list with saved/available sections

## 🔧 To Test in Ableton M4L

### **Wired Mode (USB via Bridge):**
1. Connect TDS-8 via USB
2. Bridge broadcasts `/ipupdate 127.0.0.1` to port 9000
3. M4L receives on `udpreceive 9000`
4. M4L sets host to `127.0.0.1`
5. M4L fetches tracks: `GET http://127.0.0.1:8088/tracks`

### **Expected M4L Flow:**
```
udpreceive 9000 → /ipupdate 127.0.0.1 → unpack → prepend host → host 127.0.0.1
                                                                      ↓
                                                            udpsend 0.0.0.0 8000
```

**Issue:** M4L sends OSC to port 8000, but bridge HTTP is on 8088!

### **Two Options:**
1. **M4L uses HTTP** to fetch tracks (not OSC)
2. **Bridge adds OSC listener** on port 8000 (needs implementation)

## 🚀 How to Start Bridge

```bash
cd /Users/test/Music/TDS-8/tds8-bridge
npm run electron
```

**Or use the launcher:**
```bash
./bridge-launcher.sh
```

## 📝 Known Issues

1. **Firmware 404** - manifest.json not on GitHub yet (local fallback works)
2. **M4L port mismatch** - M4L sends to 8000, bridge is on 8088
3. **Need to test WiFi mode** - Full WiFi workflow not tested yet

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Test M4L "Refresh displays" - verify it receives `/ipupdate`
2. Decide: HTTP or OSC for M4L communication?
3. Test WiFi mode end-to-end
4. Upload manifest.json to GitHub for firmware updates
5. Arduino firmware updates (display shift, track banking, clip names)

**Bridge is ready for testing!** 🎵
