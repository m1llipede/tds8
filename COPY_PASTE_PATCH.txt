ALTERNATIVE: MANUAL BUILD
=========================

If the above doesn't work (Max can be picky about formats), follow these steps:

STEP 1: Create these objects (press N, type the text, press Enter):

Row 1:
- number (label it "Offset")
- comment "Track Offset (0, 8, 16, 24...)"

Row 2:
- button (make it big)
- comment "Click to Refresh"

Row 3:
- t b b

Row 4:
- message: 0
- uzi 8 0

Row 5:
- unpack i i

Row 6:
- t i i i

Row 7:
- + (plus object)
- message: path live_set visible_tracks $1

Row 8:
- live.path

Row 9:
- t b l

Row 10:
- message: get name
- live.observer

Row 11:
- unpack s s

Row 12:
- pack i s i

Row 13:
- prepend /trackname

Row 14:
- udpsend 127.0.0.1 8000
- print OSC_OUT


STEP 2: Connect them (click outlet, drag to inlet):

1. button → t b b
2. t b b (left) → uzi
3. t b b (right) → message "0"
4. message "0" → uzi (right inlet)
5. uzi → unpack i i
6. unpack → t i i i
7. t i i i (left) → pack i s i (left inlet)
8. t i i i (middle) → + (left inlet)
9. offset number → + (right inlet)
10. + → message "path live_set visible_tracks $1"
11. + → pack i s i (right inlet)
12. message → live.path
13. live.path (right outlet) → t b l
14. t b l (left) → message "get name"
15. message "get name" → live.observer (left)
16. t b l (right) → live.observer (right)
17. live.observer → unpack s s
18. unpack s s (right) → pack i s i (middle inlet)
19. pack i s i → prepend /trackname
20. prepend → udpsend
21. prepend → print


STEP 3: Test it!

1. Set offset to 0
2. Click the button
3. Open Max console (Cmd+B on Mac, Ctrl+B on Windows)
4. Should see: /trackname 0 "Track Name" 0


TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

Problem: Max says "couldn't create"
Solution: Check spelling of object names exactly

Problem: No output in console
Solution: Make sure print is connected

Problem: "live.path" errors
Solution: Make sure message is exactly: path live_set visible_tracks $1

Problem: Wrong track names
Solution: Use "visible_tracks" not "tracks"

Problem: Nothing sent to Bridge
Solution: Check Bridge is running on port 8088


WHAT EACH PART DOES:
====================

number → Stores offset (0, 8, 16, etc.)
button → Triggers the refresh
t b b → Splits signal into two
0 → Resets the counter
uzi 8 0 → Loops 8 times (0-7)
unpack i i → Gets loop index
t i i i → Splits index into 3 copies
+ → Adds offset to index (0+8=8, 1+8=9, etc.)
path message → Builds path to track in Live
live.path → Gets reference to track
t b l → Splits into bang and list
get name → Asks for track name
live.observer → Gets the name from Live
unpack s s → Extracts the name string
pack i s i → Combines: display_index, name, actual_track
prepend → Adds "/trackname" to front
udpsend → Sends OSC to Bridge (port 8000)
print → Shows output in console (for debugging)


EXPECTED OUTPUT:
================

When offset = 0:
/trackname 0 "1-Audio" 0
/trackname 1 "2-Audio" 1
/trackname 2 "3-Audio" 2
...

When offset = 8:
/trackname 0 "9-Audio" 8
/trackname 1 "10-Audio" 9
/trackname 2 "11-Audio" 10
...


SAVE YOUR WORK:
===============

1. File → Save As
2. Name: TDS-8 Auto.amxd
3. Save in: Ableton User Library/Presets/Audio Effects/Max Audio Effect/
4. Now you can drag it onto any track!
